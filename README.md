# SOLID-Demo
Demonstration of SOLID Object-Oriented Principles

**SOLID** is an acronym that stands for
* **Single Responsibility Principle**  
Classes should handle the minimum amount of action necessary to give the client flexibility in choosing which classes to instantiate/extend.
* **Open-Closed Principle**  
Classes shouldn't have to be modified to work in different situations/be extended. Having classes inherit from interfaces facilitates this.
* **Liskov Substitution Principle**  
Derived class should be able to be completely substitutable for its base class.
* **Interface Segregation Principle**  
Interfaces should not contains what might be extraneous fields depending on its usage. This avoids forcing the client to implement functions they do not require.
* **Dependence Inversion Principle**  
High level classes should not be dependent on the lower level design of whatever they are accessing/calling. They should depend on abstractions, not concretions.
